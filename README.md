# Quantum Computing Project
This is the repository for our group for the Quantum Computing Project. This is my initial draft of our terms/rules please comment or contribute if you disagree or have something to add. I expect this README will develop a lot over the semester. We will use this as proof of our team management. 

This repo is initially public, I will soon make it private so if you do not already have a GitHub account please create one so I can add you. To anyone who wishes to connect their machine to the repo (coders primarily) we will need to generate SSH keys, which we can do one-to-one as required. 

# Team 
A short biography of each team member will be written into the team directory. Please complete this as soon as possible. 

## Roles 
Initially I (Conner) will handle task management. There will be a "department lead" for science, coding and writing. The "heads" are highlighted in bold below. 
This can be changed however you like but a head should be nominated. The head of department will be responsible for communicating the progress and problems being experienced by that team in any meeting. 
A wider discussion with all team members can be developed after the main points are communicated by the heads. 

### Scientific Concepts
We should all have a pretty strong grasp of the science, but in an effort to share the burden initially the science will be handled predominantly by: 
* **Name**
* Name

### Coding
Initially, the programming aspect will be handled predominantly by: 
* **Name** 
* Conner

### Writing 
This is the writing of the written report as well as the creation of the Beamer slides for the presentation. 
* **Name**
* Julia

# Communication 
WhatsApp and the (already established) group chat will be used for ad-hoc or immediate need for communication. Everything else should be done async - that is - you should not expect an immedaite response. 
For this we will use comments/mentions in Overleaf, comments/mentions/allocations in ToDoist and comments/mentions/pull-requests in GitHub. This will take a while to get used to but allows everyone the autonomy to complete their own work on their own schedule. Due dates on tasks allocated to you will therefore become your "workstack" and is what you should monitor.   

# Task Management 
[Link to Project](https://app.todoist.com/app/project/2326866532)
Task management will be done predominantly through ToDoist - a web app for managing tasks. It has an Android and IOS app too. Please create an account and put your details into the WhatsApp chat so I can add you to the project. Anyone can create a task, when you do please assign a deadline, a section and a person to the task. If discussion is required please use the comments on the task and only mark as complete when the actual task is complete. Subtasks are also useful if the initial task becomes excessively complicated.  You can filter the tasks in ToDoist for "Upcoming" and assigned to you which will make completing the work assigned to you very simple.If you feel you could be doing more or have ideas which are not already listed, please comment on an existing task or create a new one. 
(TODO - Link to Project here). 

# Source Control 
Git (the software behind GitHub) will be used for source control of the code. GitHub makes the basic features very accessible. 

## Features
Features should be included using a feature branch. That is, branch the repo, develop the feature, ensure tests are passing and then create a pull-request to merge the branch into main. 

## Commits
Please make commit messages informative. We can discuss methods like atomic commits but other than the initial writing of boilerplates and templates commit messages such as "WIP" and "updates" are unacceptable. 

# Coding Standard
We will write in Python and adopt the PEP 8 coding standard. It would be a good idea to install a linter onto the machine you plan to use for coding and have it monitor the standard for you **from the outset.**

# Documentation 
The code will be documented using Python docstrings. The exact implementation and style will be determined. 

# Written Report 
This should be approximately 30 pages. It will be typset in LaTeX and hosted on Overleaf. Harry will ensure that all team members have access to the project.

# Presentation
The slides for the presentation will also be typeset in LaTeX using the Beamer format. These will be hosted separately on Overleaf and again, Harry will ensure that all team members have access to the project.

# Contribution 
Please feel free to edit this file (the GitHub web GUI is probably the easiest way if you are unfamiliar) for any reason. All changes will be checked by my for inclusion in the live document.
